2. Reasonable comments required.
3. Make sure to pass the unit tests.

Issues
------

1. Only bugs and feature requests are accepted here.
2. Shall only work on important features. If the feature you're asking only benefits a few people, you'd better implement the feature yourself and send us a pull request, or ask some of your friends to do so.
3. Issues in languages other than English and Chinese will be Google translated into English later.
